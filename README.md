# CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

## Description

This is the second weeks homework assignment. It required using Bootstrap to develop a responsive portfolio page that included a navbar and a responsive layout. I included the use of semantic html, and making sure the links worked. I also made sure the navbar matched on each webpage. I felt really challenged by the assignment and I am not really happy with the result. I will be using a tutor in the coming days to try to better my skills of responsive layouts.
